# Rockchip Model Licensing

Any BrightSign Model Package (BSMP) must include one or more models.  Using any model from the [Rockchip model zoo](https://github.com/airockchip/rknn_model_zoo) "links" that model to the BSMP.  This means that the BSMP must adhere to the license of the model.

This review was last updated on May 20, 2025 as a convenience for developers.  

We will try to maintain this document, but **it is the users responsibility to verify this information and adhering to all license terms**.

## Analysis of Licensing in the Model Zoo

**Dominant License Types:** The Rockchip Model Zoo includes a mix of permissive licenses (Apache 2.0 and MIT) and copyleft licenses (GPL/AGPL). Notably, many of the **object detection models (YOLO family)** are released under **strong copyleft licenses (GPL-3.0 or AGPL-3.0)**. In contrast, **classification, segmentation, and speech/NLP models** often use **permissive licenses** like Apache 2.0 or MIT, which impose minimal restrictions. A few models carry special terms (e.g., Meta’s MMS-TTS under CC BY-NC 4.0, which prohibits commercial use entirely). Overall, there is a clear split: **YOLO-based models dominate the copyleft category**, while many other models are under more permissive terms.

**Restrictions and Red Flags:** Developers need to be cautious with the **GPL/AGPL-licensed models**. These licenses **require that any software incorporating those models be released under the same license** if distributed, effectively **forcing open-source release of your code**. This is a major red flag for commercial or closed-source applications – using, for example, YOLOv5 or YOLOv8 directly in a proprietary product would violate the license unless the entire application’s source is made public. The AGPL-3.0 is even stricter than GPL-3.0, extending the copyleft requirement to network services (SaaS), which means even server-side use can trigger the open-source obligation. Another red flag is the **Creative Commons BY-NC 4.0 license** on the MMS-TTS model, which **explicitly disallows commercial use**. This means it cannot be integrated into any revenue-generating or proprietary product. In summary, any model under GPL-3.0, AGPL-3.0, or CC BY-NC is **problematic for closed-source or commercial use** – either requiring open-sourcing your project or barring commercial use outright.

**Recommendations for Developers:** When evaluating models from the Rockchip Model Zoo, **identify the license early and plan accordingly**. For commercial or closed-source projects, prefer models under **permissive licenses (MIT or Apache 2.0)** as they allow integration without imposing open-source requirements. For example, one might choose **YOLOX or PP-YOLOE (Apache 2.0)** as alternatives to YOLOv5/YOLOv8, since they offer similar object detection capabilities without the copyleft strings attached. If a high-performance model is only available under GPL/AGPL (such as YOLOv8), you have a few options:

1. **Obtain a commercial license** from the authors (e.g., Ultralytics offers enterprise licensing for YOLO models to bypass GPL/AGPL), or
2. **Use the model as a separate service** with a clearly separated interface (to try to avoid derivative work clauses – though this is legally gray, especially with AGPL).

Always **document and comply with attribution requirements** – even permissive licenses require that you credit the original source and include the license text in your product’s documentation or about page. For non-commercial licensed content like MMS-TTS, avoid any use in a profit-making context unless you obtain permission or find an alternative model.

Finally, maintain an up-to-date understanding of each model’s license. License information can sometimes change with new releases, so regularly **check the official repository or model card** for any updates. By choosing permissively licensed models whenever possible and respecting the constraints of copyleft licenses, developers can leverage the Rockchip Model Zoo effectively while **avoiding legal risks** in their projects.
